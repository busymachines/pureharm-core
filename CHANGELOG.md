# 0.1.0

Split out from [pureharm](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm) as of version `0.0.7`.

Newly cross published for both Scala 2.13, and 3.0.0-RC1 on JVM and JS runtimes.

- add instance for Show[Throwable] to `busymachines.pureharm.PureharmCoreImplicits`

`busymachines.pureharm.anomaly`:
- add `AnomalyLike` super-type that is inherited by `Anomaly`, `Catastrophe`, `Anomalies`, this allows
  for easy non-anomaly catch-all that allows rethrowing.
